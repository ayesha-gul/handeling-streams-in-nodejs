WHAT IS BIRYANI?
Biryani is an intricate rice dish made with layers of curried meat and rice. Given its use of adornments and luxurious finishes, it’s no surprise that biryani has roots in Persian cuisine.

There are two main methods of making biryani:

Kachi (raw) biryani, made with raw meat and parboiled rice and cooked together, and
Pakki (cooked) biryani, in which cooked meat and parboiled rice are steamed together. 
In Pakistan, pakki (or cooked) biryani is most common, with several prominent varieties such as Sindhi, Karachi-style, and Bombay biryani. This recipe is an amalgamation of these styles and is similar to what you’d find at a typical Pakistani or Indian restaurant or dinner party.
